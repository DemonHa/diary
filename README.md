### Hello 👋. Thank you for passing by to see my diary.
### Here i will keep track of my progress 📈

- Day 1 (Monday 4, July 2022)

I strugle 😣 with system design. I was thinking about system requirements and how i can design my system so i can fullfill and requirment. After finally planing how the system is going to work we finally started to design the tables and implement them. We also filled the tables with seed so it will be easy to test. That was the easy part 😜

- Day 2 (Tuesday 5, July 2022)

We first created the module to fetch the data from database 📙 and also a simple logic to create an answer. And then we finally started to work on something visual 😂. We created the starter template for the frontend so it will be a good starting point for tommorow. Everything went great, i have a lot of fun working on it and playing ping pong 🏓.

- Day 3 (Wednesday 6, July 2022)

We finally 😌 finish frontend for the survey app. It could support four types of input and its easy to add more. We plan to refactor our code so it will be even easier to add new features later 😊.

2 days later.. (Actually not 2 days but only a few hours)
I could not stay and do something else so i grab my laptop and start to code 💻. I found a bug that was a React thing 💩 and i closed the #1 issue 5 minutes later 🤦‍♂️. It was great 🤷‍♀️. I stoped codding and thought about what we are gonna do for the next day. I wrote a detailed plan which we will follow next day (hopefully if my laptop is still working). I also slept 😴.

- Day 4 (Thursday 7, July  2022)

First thing i did in the mornning was to start implementing Redux. After getting some outsider opinion i decide to trash my work and just let it as it was 😔. It was a pain to see my changes disappear in the air 🤐. Then i reforce myself and start to work on server side to validate the data and save to the database. My team mate started to work in frontend of backoffice. I still think we should make a better design but anyway, i will think it 🤐. After finishing this day it was time to celebrate 😂, and my celebration was ofcourse a good ping pong game 🎉.

I think we are advanced with our plan. My plan for tommorow is to close the frontend of the backoffice app and then i will start to work on the backend part. We can do it. 🙌.

Oh, there is something more. I am thinking if i should add another column to check if the user has already submited the form, so it can not submit or change his questions anymore. If he came back to the same link he will be faced with a kindly reminder to get the hell out of there 😂.

Why are u still reading this? 😂

- Day 5 (Friday 8, July  2022)

We saw that we had some problems 😟 with the sections and we did some small changes to the database. Then we strugle 😩 to create the query for the seeds. Then we strugle again 😩🔁 with asnwer submition because we could not use useQuery hook inside a function, but we finally solve it. It was raining 🌧️ outside so maybe that caused some issues 😂. Later in the evening we worked in backend part to add some more validation 👮.

- Day 6 (Saturday 9, July  2022)

Today was holiday 
🏖️, but not for me. I love ❤ to code, so i did make some small changes to handle error messages beautifully and to reload data when the user came back 😎.
